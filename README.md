# Docker Image for Bitcoin Core

This docker image has been created to run Bitcoin Core from an image that is built from the actual source code from the project,
so as not to have to trust any other providers of pre-compiled docker images. Some other images cannot be trusted.

Now updated to: ```v28.1```
Build and operation uses: ```Ubuntu 22.04```
